# Timecard Processor

Have you found yourself in need of processing .csv files of timecard data from an obscure proprietary timecard program according to a set of rules that probably only applies in Massachusetts? If so, you're in luck! 

Introducing: the Timecard Processor.

## Building on windows

Run `windows-build.bat` and follow the instructions. Note: make sure you've satisfied the requirements for the [fman build system](https://github.com/mherrmann/fbs-tutorial). This means python versions 3.5 and 3.6, plus NSIS if you're compiling for windows.

## What program is this for?

[Econsoft Timecard Manager Pro](http://www.econsoft.com/). Make sure you export your timecard data as .csv files!
